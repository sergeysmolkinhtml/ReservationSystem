**Task from UpWork!**

Hi,
I'm looking for help to build a straightforward reservation system in Laravel. I've built a similar system using node/express/mongo, but want to scale the project and add some functionalities.

Essentially, the system allows for adding clients, activities, and send out a link to fill in their sizes. The system also generates a PDF for each trip on demand for the guide.

I'm short on time so I'd appreciate help :)

Code should be clean, commented, DRY,... etc etc
Well built logic, readable, and project structure. We'll get a basic version up and running, then add functionalities along the way, such as online payment integration etc... layout should be responsive and optimised for mobile.

Thanks for reading!
